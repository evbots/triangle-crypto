Welcome to the triangle crypto community. 

# What's this all about?

There's a lot of people interested in cryptocurrency, smart contracts, and applications of blockchain in the triangle area. This group serves to be a meeting space online and IRL for those people. We currently have a discord chat room set up, and will occasionally schedule meetups and social events for people to gather and talk about the latest trends. If you're just getting started and have questions, join! If you've been using crypto software for a while, join! All are welcome.

## Who should join?

Any human interested in crypto. Common topics include cryptocurrency, smart contracts, DeFi, NFTs, and DAOs.


## How do I get involved?

Right now we have a discord chat room set up - you should join! [Here's the link]({{ site.header_links.discord }}). We'll likely have other spaces set up in the future (online forum, telegram). Feel free to suggest other ways to connect online.

## Are you on Meetup.com?

Not yet. We've found meetup to be pretty annoying for scheduling events, and there is no longer a free tier. We'll schedule events via chat groups and get out the word that way.

## Sign up for the Newsletter!

We promise this is not an annoying newsletter. The list is managed via MailChimp, which means each email comes with an unsubscribe link in the footer. We envision sending 2-3 emails a year, max.
